## Challenge: Movie Theater Reservation Countdown
## Objective
Simulate a countdown timer for a movie theater’s online reservation system. Customers have limited time to make their seat selection, and the program must display reminders and a timeout message.

### Challenge Description
The movie theater has implemented online reservations through their website. From the seat selection page, customers only have 10 minutes to confirm their choice.

Write a Python program that:

Starts from mins = 10.

Uses a while loop to count down from 10 to 0.

Uses the `sleep()` function to pause for 1 second between each countdown step.

Prints reminders depending on how many minutes are left:

At 5 minutes → print *"Place your reservation soon! 5 minutes remaining."*

At 2 minutes → print *"Don't lose your seats! 2 minutes remaining."*

At 0 minutes → print *"User timed out."*

Otherwise → print the current countdown number.


### Skills Practiced

`while` loops

Conditional statements `(if / elif / else)`

Using the modular approach `(time.sleep())`

Real-world problem simulation
